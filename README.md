Hello there! 👋

I’m @jouna227, and here’s a bit about me. 🌟

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I am a proud husband and father of two wonderful kids. 
✝️ I serve as a life group leader at Chets Creek Church, Hodges Campus.
👀 I enjoy playing video games with my kids.
🌱 I recently graduated from the Data Science program at TripleTen. I am passionate about Machine Learning, Python, SciKit, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I love exploring data and uncovering the hidden stories within it.
🤍 I am from Puerto Rico and I speak Spanish.
💞 In my free time, I enjoy exploring data sets to polish my skills. I’m open to collaborating on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects or anything related to Python.
