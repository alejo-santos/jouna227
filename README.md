Hi there! 👋

I’m @jouna227, and I’m thrilled to share a bit about myself. 🌟

👀 I’m passionate about video games, especially Call of Duty. When I’m not gaming, you’ll find me immersed in movies or exploring new ones.
🌱 Currently, I’m diving deep into the world of Data Science. I’m learning essential tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Exploring data and uncovering insights excites me!
🤍 Hablo Español
💞 I’m open to collaborating on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects or anything related to Python. Let’s build something awesome together!
📫 You can reach me via email at Jouna227@gmail.com.

😄 My pronouns? Let’s go with “Try/Me”—a playful twist!
⚡ Did you know? I have a soft spot for math. Calculus, in particular, gets my neurons firing! 🧠
